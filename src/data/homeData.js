	text: "I was born and raised in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico. My native language is Spanish, but I speak English fluently. I am 22 years old, and I like video games and reading. Since I was little, I have been influenced by playing online computer games, which interested me in how technology works. Throughout my studies, I realized that what I liked about computers was their coding and security side. I enjoy building stuff, figuring out how things work, and how to break them. Since I come from a small island, I have always had a big concern for the cybersecurity of my country. One of my biggest goals is to become an outstanding Computer Science and Cybersecurity professional that can improve the cybersecurity infrastructure of Puerto Rico. My primary interests are Penetration Testing and Web Application Security.",
    //I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am also a recipient of the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS). I recently moved to Norfolk, Virginia to pursue a Master's in Cybersecurity

In May, 2022 I officially obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor Concentration in Videogame Design and Development. In 2021, I participated in a Summer Research for Undergraduates which gave me the opportunity to do research on an Emerging Cybersecurity Topic. After that I was told that I could apply to the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service. When I got accepted I moved to Norfolk, VA to pursue a Master's in Cybersecurity in Old Dominion University. With this opportunity I aim to work for the goverment, get as much certifications I can, and prepare myself to be the professional I aspire to be.",

The scholarship program provides two to three years of support to selected students. This includes a full in-state tuition scholarship, an annual stipend, and a professional development allowance. In exchange, each student must work for the federal government in select cybersecurity positions for the same number of years. My experience so far has been great. I have learned a lot and made many connections, and the program has prepared me professionally. I have met my peers, and they have strong ambitions and goals. I look forward to working with every one of them in the future.",
