I enjoy building stuff, figuring out how things work, and how to break them. Since I come from a small island, I have always had a big concern for the cybersecurity of my country. One of my biggest goals is to become an outstanding Computer Science and Cybersecurity professional that can improve the cybersecurity infrastructure of Puerto Rico. My primary interests are Penetration Testing and Web Application Security.",
